# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions to the 2021 Advent of Code.

~~This year, I decided to write my solutions in Haskell to learn more about the programming language, and as a unique challenge.~~

This year, I started my solutions in Haskell and made it to around day 10 before that started getting annoying. I reserve the right to solve whichever problems in Haskell I feel like.
